Basic C++ Programs
This repository contains a collection of simple C++ programs designed for beginners. Each program demonstrates a fundamental programming concept, focusing on conditional statements and basic input/output operations.

Programs Included
1. Even or Odd Checker
This program prompts the user to enter an integer and then determines if that number is even or odd.

Concept: Basic if-else statement.

Logic: It uses the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is evenly divisible by 2.

2. Vowel or Consonant Checker
This program asks the user for a single character and identifies whether it is a vowel or a consonant.

Concept: if-else statement with multiple logical OR (||) conditions.

Logic: It checks the input character against all lowercase and uppercase vowels.

3. Largest of Three Numbers
This program takes three integer inputs from the user and finds the largest number among them.

Concept: if-else if-else ladder.

Logic: It sequentially compares the three numbers to determine the greatest one.

4. Simple Menu with Switch-Case
This program displays a menu and, based on the user's choice, prints specific employee information.

Concept: switch-case statement.

Logic: It uses a switch statement to execute a specific block of code corresponding to the user's input. A default case handles invalid choices.

# C++ Loop & Pattern Printing Exercises üöÄ

A collection of simple C++ programs demonstrating fundamental concepts like `for` loops, nested loops, conditional logic, and basic I/O operations. This repository is perfect for beginners getting comfortable with the basics of C++.

## üìã About The Project

This repository contains several small, self-contained C++ files, each designed to illustrate a specific programming concept. The exercises were created as part of a learning module (Experiment 6) and cover:

* Simple iteration with `for` loops.
* Conditional logic with `if` statements.
* Basic string input and manipulation.
* Using nested loops to create text-based patterns like triangles and diamonds.

## ‚ú® Core Concepts Illustrated

This collection is built around a few essential programming pillars. Each concept is demonstrated through one or more of the included code examples.

### The `for` Loop: Controlled Repetition üîÅ

The **`for` loop** is the heart of this repository. It provides a clean and powerful way to execute a block of code a specific number of times. You'll see it used for simple iteration (`exp6.cc`), filtering data (`exp6b.cc`), and processing strings character-by-character (`exp6d.cc`). Its structure‚Äîinitialization, condition, and update‚Äîis a cornerstone of imperative programming.

### Nested Loops: Building Patterns üí†

The magic of creating 2D shapes and patterns comes from **nested loops**. By placing one loop inside another, the inner loop completes its full cycle for every single iteration of the outer loop. This row-and-column logic is used to construct the right-angled triangles (`exp6f.cc`, `exp6g.cc`), the inverted pyramid (`exp6i.cc`), and the symmetrical diamond (`exp6h.cc`).

### Conditional Logic with `if` Statements ü§î

To make programs intelligent, they need to make decisions. The **`if` statement** executes code only when a specific condition is true. This is demonstrated in the password validator (`exp6c.cc`), which checks for invalid characters, and in the even-number finder (`exp6b.cc`), which uses the modulo operator (`%`) to test for divisibility.

### Basic String Manipulation üìù

Text is a fundamental data type, and these examples cover basic **`string`** handling. You will find code that reads strings from user input, checks their length using `.length()` (`exp6d.cc`), and accesses individual characters by their index (`password[i]`) to validate them (`exp6c.cc`).

## üìÇ Code Overview

Here is a summary of what each file does:

| File Name | Description | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`exp6.cc`** | Prints the string "SIT" six times. | Simple `for` loop |
| **`exp6b.cc`** | Prints all even numbers from 0 to 10. | `for` loop, `if`, modulo `%` |
| **`exp6c.cc`** | A basic password validator that checks for forbidden characters. | `string`, `for` loop, `if` |
| **`exp6d.cc`** | Reverses a given 11-character string (e.g., a PRN). | `string`, `for` loop (reverse) |
| **`exp6e.cc`** | Demonstrates the execution flow of nested `for` loops. | Nested `for` loops |
| **`exp6f.cc`** | Prints a right-angled triangle pattern using asterisks (`*`). | Nested `for` loops |
| **`exp6g.cc`** | Prints a right-angled triangle with incrementing numbers. | Nested `for` loops, counter variable |
| **`exp6h.cc`** | Prints a diamond pattern using asterisks (`*`). | Multiple `for` loops |
| **`exp6i.cc`** | Prints an inverted (upside-down) triangle pattern using asterisks. | Nested `for` loops |
