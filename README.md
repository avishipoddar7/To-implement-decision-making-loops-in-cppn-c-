# C++ Fundamentals: A Practical Guide to Loops & Patterns

This repository contains a focused collection of C++ programs designed to build a strong, practical understanding of fundamental programming concepts. It serves as a hands-on guide to mastering control flow, from simple repetition to the creation of complex, text-based patterns.

## ‚ú® Core Concepts Illustrated

This collection is built around a few essential programming pillars. Each concept is demonstrated through one or more of the included code examples.

### The `for` Loop: Controlled Repetition üîÅ

The **`for` loop** is the heart of this repository. It provides a clean and powerful way to execute a block of code a specific number of times. You'll see it used for simple iteration (`exp6.cc`), filtering data (`exp6b.cc`), and processing strings character-by-character (`exp6d.cc`). Its structure‚Äîinitialization, condition, and update‚Äîis a cornerstone of imperative programming.

### Nested Loops: Building Patterns üí†

The magic of creating 2D shapes and patterns comes from **nested loops**. By placing one loop inside another, the inner loop completes its full cycle for every single iteration of the outer loop. This row-and-column logic is used to construct the right-angled triangles (`exp6f.cc`, `exp6g.cc`), the inverted pyramid (`exp6i.cc`), and the symmetrical diamond (`exp6h.cc`).

### Conditional Logic with `if` Statements ü§î

To make programs intelligent, they need to make decisions. The **`if` statement** executes code only when a specific condition is true. This is demonstrated in the password validator (`exp6c.cc`), which checks for invalid characters, and in the even-number finder (`exp6b.cc`), which uses the modulo operator (`%`) to test for divisibility.

### Basic String Manipulation üìù

Text is a fundamental data type, and these examples cover basic **`string`** handling. You will find code that reads strings from user input, checks their length using `.length()` (`exp6d.cc`), and accesses individual characters by their index (`password[i]`) to validate them (`exp6c.cc`).
